# forest_based_tree
* The code implements a novel method for converting a random forest into a single decision tree
* Running the entire experiment is done by running 'Main.ipynb'
* Analyzing the results can be done by running the code in 'Analyze results.ipynb'
* The code contains two pruning approaches : 
       The first is in 'pruningFunctions.py' 
       The second, which is extremely faster, is in 'QuickPruning.py'
